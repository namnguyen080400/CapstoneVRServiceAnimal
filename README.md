This Unity project features a voice- and gesture-controlled virtual dog that responds to natural language and hand gestures in a Passthrough XR environment. Built with XR Interaction Toolkit, Wit.ai, and Meta XR SDK, the dog can follow commands, perform actions, and interact with the player.

**Features Implemented**
- Voice control via Wit.ai
- Hand gesture recognition using XR Hands
- Dog behaviors: walk, sit, bark, wag tail, follow, approach
- “Follow me” and “Come here” support
- Interactive animations and sound effects
- Passthrough AR (real-world background)
